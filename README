This is the original version for Arduino nano
The setup includes an OrangePI board running linux
The arduino reads from the sensor and sends to 
# the orangePI. The oPI is configured with a cron
# to send the readings to a server in the cloud
# that adds them to a MySQL database and has
# a grafana chart using them.

# Theres a new version for ESP8266, that makes
# possible to remove the OrangePI from the 
# equation.

# to burn the arduino nano
